# SkillsOps Runbook — Getting Started From Scratch

A hands-on walkthrough for a new customer, exercising the full governed
lifecycle end to end: **author → validate → audit → score → register (RBAC) →
publish → runtime policy → compliance → progressive deploy → enterprise**.

Every command below is real. Copy-paste in order. Expected output is described
inline. Tested on Python 3.10–3.13.

> Convention: the CLI is `skillctl`; the package is `skillsops`. Local state
> (credentials, policy/deployment/lineage DBs) lives under `~/.skillctl/`.

## 0. Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install skillsops                      # core CLI (only dependency: pyyaml)

# Optional extras, added as you need them:
pip install "skillsops[server]"            # registry server (FastAPI)
pip install "skillsops[observability]"     # OpenTelemetry tracing
pip install "skillsops[policy-opa]"        # OPA policy integration

skillctl version
skillctl --help        # note the command groups: validate, eval, auth, rbac,
                       # policy, observe, compliance, deploy, ci, forensics, ...
```

---

## 1. Author a skill (M0)

```bash
mkdir demo && cd demo
skillctl create skill my-org/hello
# → scaffolds skill.yaml + SKILL.md + evals/

# Edit SKILL.md and set a real description in skill.yaml, then:
skillctl validate .
# → ✓ schema · 0 errors   semver · OK   capabilities · declared
```

A missing/invalid `version` or `name` fails validation with a clear `VAL-*`
code — that is the deterministic schema contract gate.

---

## 2. Security audit + deterministic score (M0)

```bash
skillctl eval audit .
# → A–F grade across 9 threat categories. A CRITICAL finding (e.g. a hardcoded
#   AWS key) exits non-zero and would block publishing.

skillctl eval report . --format json
# → deterministic governance score = 80% security audit + 20% schema contract.
#   Run it again — the score is identical (no LLM, fully reproducible).
```

Try the security gate: drop `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/...EXAMPLEKEY"`
into SKILL.md and re-run `skillctl eval audit .` → CRITICAL `SEC-001`, exit code 2.
Remove it before continuing.

---

## 3. Stand up a governed registry with RBAC (M1)

In a separate terminal, start the registry. On first run it bootstraps an admin
and prints credentials **once** — copy them.

```bash
skillctl serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 \
    --data-dir ~/.skillctl/registry --auto-generate-hmac-key
# stderr prints:
#   No users found — created the initial admin.
#   Username: admin
#   Password: <random>
#   Token:    sk-<random>
```

Back in your working terminal, authenticate and inspect your identity:

```bash
export REG=http://127.0.0.1:8080
skillctl auth login --registry $REG --username admin --password '<printed-password>'
skillctl auth whoami --registry $REG
# → User: admin   Roles: admin (*)   Registry: http://127.0.0.1:8080
# Credentials are stored at ~/.skillctl/credentials.json (mode 0600).
```

Create a team member and scope their role (RBAC):

```bash
# admin creates a user and grants 'author' in a namespace
curl -s -X POST $REG/api/v1/users -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"username":"alice","password":"pw-alice"}'
skillctl rbac assign --registry $REG --user alice --role author --namespace org/acme/team-ml
skillctl rbac check  --registry $REG --user alice --permission skill:publish --namespace org/acme/team-ml
# → ✗ DENIED — no role grants skill:publish (author can create, not publish)
```

This is the headline RBAC guarantee: **who can do what, to which skills, and
it's all in the HMAC-signed audit chain.**

### Restart, backup, and restore

The registry reopens the same database, blobs, audit chain, and generated HMAC
key after an ordinary restart. Keep the entire data directory on one persistent
volume; do not mount its files independently. Run one registry process per data
directory: a second process, Uvicorn worker, or replica is rejected at startup
with `E_REGISTRY_IN_USE`.

Take an offline backup so SQLite and the blob store represent the same point in
time:

```bash
# Stop the registry process or service first.
cp -a /srv/skillsops/registry /srv/skillsops/backups/registry-2026-09-09
```

Back up the whole directory, including `registry.db`, any SQLite `-wal`/`-shm`
files, `blobs/`, `audit.jsonl`, and `hmac.key`. If the HMAC key is supplied by
an external secret manager instead, back up and restore that secret through the
same system. A database-only backup loses content; a backup without the original
key cannot verify the existing audit chain. For Docker Compose, stop the
registry service and snapshot or copy the complete named volume.

Restore into an empty directory, fix ownership and mode for the registry
service account, then start SkillsOps against that directory:

```bash
cp -a /srv/skillsops/backups/registry-2026-09-09 /srv/skillsops/registry-restored
skillctl serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 \
    --data-dir /srv/skillsops/registry-restored --auto-generate-hmac-key
```

The existing HMAC key is reused; `--auto-generate-hmac-key` does not replace
it. Confirm `/api/v1/health` reports `status: ok` and `storage_status: ok`, then
verify the audit endpoint reports zero invalid entries before accepting writes.
Keep the source backup unchanged until a new version can be created, published,
and downloaded from the restored registry.

---

## 4. Publish lifecycle (create vs publish) (M1)

```bash
# A publisher (or admin) creates then publishes. Create = draft; publish = live.
skillctl publish .                 # uses stored creds; pushes to the registry
# Author 'alice' could create the skill (201) but a publish attempt returns 403
# until she's granted the 'publisher' role — verifiable in the audit log:
curl -s "$REG/api/v1/audit?limit=20" -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>"
```

---

## 5. Experimental runtime policy hooks

> These hooks are not wired into the registry or any installed IDE. The checks
> below are a dry run until your execution host explicitly wraps every
> invocation with `SkillInterceptor`.

Create and dry-run an opt-in policy configuration:

```bash
mkdir -p .skillctl && cat > .skillctl/policies.yaml <<'YAML'
policies:
  - name: rate-limit
    type: builtin.rate_limit
    config: {max_per_minute: 30, scope: actor}
  - name: business-hours
    type: builtin.time_window
    config: {allowed_hours: [9, 17], allowed_days: [0,1,2,3,4]}
  - name: no-pii
    type: builtin.pii_redaction
    config: {mode: redact}
observability:
  enabled: true
  exporter: otlp
  endpoint: http://otel-collector:4317
YAML

skillctl policy list
skillctl policy validate
skillctl policy test --as alice --roles author --namespace org/acme/team-ml
# → per-hook ALLOW/DENY with reasons, then a final VERDICT
skillctl observe status      # OpenTelemetry config/status
```

An integrating agent runtime can wrap skill execution with the interceptor (rate limits, data
boundaries, PII redaction, OPA/Cedar), traced via OpenTelemetry and recorded as
`policy_decision` events in the audit chain:

```python
from skillctl.policy import PolicyEngine, SkillInterceptor, PolicyContext
from skillctl.policy.builtin import PIIRedactionHook
engine = PolicyEngine(); engine.register(PIIRedactionHook())
out = await SkillInterceptor(engine).invoke(my_skill_fn,
        PolicyContext(actor_id="alice", skill_name="my-org/hello",
                      skill_version="0.1.0", skill_namespace="org/acme/team-ml"),
        {"q": "email me at a@x.com"})
# → emails in the output are redacted before return
```

---

## 6. Experimental compliance mapping preview

> This is non-certifying local gap analysis. CLI attestations have unverified
> identities and remain pending; the output cannot authorize a promotion or
> establish legal compliance.

```bash
skillctl compliance frameworks
# → eu-ai-act, iso-42001, nist-ai-rmf

skillctl compliance classify .
# → risk level (e.g. MINIMAL, or HIGH if the description implies hiring/biometrics)

skillctl compliance report . --framework eu-ai-act --format md
# → per-control COMPLIANT / PARTIAL / NON-COMPLIANT / PENDING, a preview score,
#   evidence references (SHA-256 hashed), and remediation recommendations

# A local note can be recorded, but it is not a verified sign-off:
skillctl compliance attest --control art-9-2-b --skill . \
    --statement "Residual risks reviewed and accepted per assessment v3"

skillctl compliance gaps . --framework eu-ai-act   # only what still needs work
```

---

## 7. Experimental deployment state model

> These commands modify `~/.skillctl/deployments.db`; they do not route live
> registry or agent traffic, collect metrics, schedule health checks, or
> trigger rollback without an integrating application.

```bash
skillctl deploy canary my-org/hello --version 0.2.0 --namespace org/acme/team-ml \
    --from 0.1.0 --stages "1,5,25,50,100" --auto-rollback
skillctl deploy status
skillctl deploy promote <deployment-id>      # advance to the next stage
skillctl deploy rollback <deployment-id> --reason "elevated error rate"
skillctl deploy history --skill my-org/hello
```

The library can model consistent-hash routing and caller-driven health
evaluation. Local deployment records may appear in a control-mapping preview,
but do not prove a production rollback mechanism exists.

---

## 8. Experimental enterprise utilities

**Local HS256 token inspection:**

```bash
# Mint a demo-only HS256 token:
TOKEN=$(python -c "from skillctl.identity import jwt; print(jwt.encode({'sub':'alice','email':'alice@acme.com','groups':['ml-team'],'aud':'skillsops','iss':'https://idp'},'shared-secret'))")
skillctl identity inspect --token "$TOKEN" --secret shared-secret \
    --issuer https://idp --audience skillsops --group-map "ml-team=publisher:org/acme"
# → Roles: publisher:org/acme  (IdP group mapped to a SkillsOps role)
```

This identity is not accepted by the registry. Production OIDC discovery,
JWKS validation, and authentication middleware are not implemented.

**Lineage queries (over caller-recorded local data):**

```bash
skillctl forensics invocations --skill org/risky --label pii \
    --since 2026-07-01 --until 2026-07-02
skillctl forensics who-accessed --data db:customers
skillctl forensics provenance --data s3:predictions   # trace output → sources
```

**CI/CD governance pipeline:**

```bash
skillctl ci list
skillctl ci init --system github      # writes .github/workflows/skillsops.yml
# Review the starter pipeline, pin dependencies, and configure approvals/secrets.
```

ABAC and multi-registry federation are available as libraries
(`skillctl.abac`, `skillctl.federation`) — see [enterprise.md](enterprise.md).

## 9. What you just proved

| Layer | Capability | Milestone |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Supply chain | schema + security gate, deterministic score | M0 |
| Access control | RBAC, scoped tokens, audited decisions | M1 |
| Experimental runtime library | opt-in policy hooks, OpenTelemetry, redaction | M2 |
| Experimental mapping | EU AI Act / ISO 42001 / NIST previews | M3 |
| Experimental rollout model | canary / blue-green / staged state machine | M3 |
| Experimental utilities | HS256 inspection, ABAC, lineage, forensics | M4 |

Registry mutations and authorization decisions are recorded in its
tamper-evident HMAC audit chain. Policy and deployment libraries emit events
only when an integrating application supplies the registry audit logger. Verify
the registry chain:

```bash
curl -s "$REG/api/v1/audit?limit=100" -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
  | python -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('integrity:', d['integrity'])"
# → {'valid': N, 'invalid': 0, 'parse_errors': 0}
```
